#jadesAtrium

## Plans:
- Add KubeJS and/or datapack compat 
- Integration with my other mods, in some way?
	- Maybe autogenned crops based on materials registered with [[Perfectly Ungeneric Objects]]?
		- In that case, would need to add extra methods for denoting if one wants to autogenerate crops, and with what texture set.
